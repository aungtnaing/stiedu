By 2013 the school had expanded to more than 1500 students spread out in its three campuses. The enrollment keep increasing as a result of programmes and courses offered from strong positive reputation, sound market targeting and robust competitive edge. From one campus in downtown Yangon, STIMU now occupies three campuses all located in the prime commercial areas of Yangon. To date there are more than 2000 students studying at STIMU.

To date, STIMU has grown to a mature academic institution with excellent academic reputation and the most prestigious private higher education University in Yangon with comprehensive program portfolio. There are five faculties, namely, Faculty of business, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Education and Linguistics, Faculty beauty art and Faculty of Health Science.
