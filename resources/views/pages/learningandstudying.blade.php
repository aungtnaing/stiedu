    <h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1. Learning and Studying at STI MU</b></p></h3> 
	<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>1.1 Learning Activities</b></p></h4>                         
   <h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> Studying will involve your participation in a wide range of teaching and learning activities. Lectures and seminars will take up some of your time but in addition you will be expected to engage in a range of activities designed to support and develop your learning. This will include reading set texts and other materials, perhaps working online, preparing for taught activity and for assessments. For each unit you study you will be provided with details of the expectations on that particular unit through Learning Management System (LMS).
The common forms of teaching and learning are:  </p></h4>

 <h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> The common forms of teaching and learning are:  </p></h4>

<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Workshops:</b></p></h3> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> Practical sessions designed to introduce you to skills, methodological frameworks and conceptual frameworks which will be foundational in developing your approach.  </p></h4>


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Lectures:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> Used to transfer and contextualise theoretical concepts relating to performance practice. You may also test out ideas in practice within the context of a lecture. Not just about sitting and listening but often interactive in approach.  </p></h4> 

<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Seminars:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Designed to involve you in discussion and detailed consideration of theoretical concepts, ideas and performance practice. Some seminars may also involve presentation of practical work to both exemplify and develop understanding on a particular topic. </p></h4> 


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Tutorials:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Small group or individual discussions with a tutor, used to enhance understanding of practice and theoretical concepts through tutor’s feedback. </p></h4> 

<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Work-based practice:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Designed to develop skills through the application of theoretical concepts in practice and to develop a practical understanding. </p></h4> 

<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Guided Learning:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Designed to support your learning through specific activities which augment, extend and deepen what’s covered in timetabled teaching activities. </p></h4> 

<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Independent Learning:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">This is a crucial part of developing as a learner. Independent Learning is designed to facilitate your independence through enabling you to take responsibility for your learning. You will be required to prepare work outside the class/lecture contact time and should regard this in the same way as preparation and research towards any assignment. The practice of developing an independent, self-motivated approach to learning and delivery of your work is essential to your success and to achieving good marks. </p></h4> 


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Autonomous Learning:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">For some units, particularly at the end of your course, you may be responsible for finding your own material relevant to your specific interests.  </p></h4> 


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>E-Course Management Support:</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">STIMU developed an electronic course management system, named the STIMU Learning Management System (LMS) that helps facilitate the learning of students more effectively and efficiently. The tool clearly closes the gap in information flows among the different campus constituents and ensures that necessary actions are complied with. Through the system, transparency is also achieved and hence an improved accountability in standards enforcement and compliance.
Students and teachers are given individual accounts to access the system. Each of the students are guided in the use of the LMS and given ample time to practice using the system in the campus computer laboratory and through the assistance of the STIMU IT instructors who extend group and individual orientation on the use of the system. Schedules for tutoring on the use of the system are centrally arranged in the Office. Among the major use of the system are as follows:  </p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . The system connects students and teachers in various aspects in their academic undertaking. It also serves as a sounding board and feedback forum among students and teachers.  </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Sharing of different course materials  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Show all upcoming events and assignment deadlines and exam schedules  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Keep record on user activities in the system </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Monitor students progress and attendance  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Giving different class activities, assignments, quiz, forums  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Fast and easy communications </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Serves as a forum for discussion, allows students to send mails to each other, chat for instant messages,  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Postings of course contents and other learning materials, calendar of activities, assignments and submission of assignments online, grades posted for students to view.  </p></h4>


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1.2 Attendance and Participating In Classes</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Studying at the STI Myanmar University is not just about subject knowledge. We are also concerned to help you develop your wider attributes and skills. To do this you will need to attend and actively engage in the range of learning activities that have been carefully designed into your course. Your attendance in your classes is fundamental to your academic development, and for that reason we will monitor your attendance and contact you if it gives cause for concern.
Support will be provided, but as a university student you will be expected to take an increasing responsibility for your own learning.  It is very different from school or work environments, and on your journey you will learn not only about your subject, but about yourself and your strengths.
All students are expected to demonstrate the same professionalism expected within a professional environment:  </p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Prompt attendance at all scheduled sessions. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Involvement and engagement with tasks and sessions. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Submission of all required materials within deadlines.  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Notification in advance of any problems which prevent your attendance or submission of work. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Not to leave and re-enter rooms during teaching sessions without a medical reason. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . To switch mobile devices off unless you are using one as an integral technology for the session. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . To facilitate an ideal learning environment for yourself and those students around you. </p></h4>



<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1.3 Skills Development</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">One of the particular advantages of studying at the STI Myanmar University is the specialised support which is available to enable you to develop your individual skills and professionalism.
While your own individual involvement and approach to your studies is essential, the way you study and learn is collaborative. During your studies you will learn to develop particular skills or understanding. Learning will happen with lecturers, your personal academic tutor, course or unit tutors, your peers, professional services staff, and through your own research.
There will be times when you will be directed to seek advice from support teams or specialist services, but if you feel that you need additional assistance with your studies, you should not wait until someone refers you for help.  </p></h4> 


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1.4 Learning Resources</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Although the Internet is a place to look for materials and resources to support your learning, not everything on the worldwide web is academic, of equal value or reliable. You will need to make judgements about the relevance and accuracy of anything you find there. You will also need to cite it appropriately. 
A good place to start looking for information on your subject is the books and journals (both print and electronic) that are purchased by the Library. The online VLE, Breo, which will include designated reading lists and online subject guides will identify some of the best additional resources available to you. 
Finding the right information and search techniques to develop your subject knowledge and complete your assignments can be hard. Your Librarian will be able to help you identify the best resources quickly. 
Every library has ground rules to ensure everyone is treated fairly and can use the resources effectively. These range from returning books with fines for late returns, to guidelines as to what is expected in the library areas. Please make yourself familiar with these rules so that you don't inadvertently fall foul of the rules. 
The facilities will include appropriate teaching and learning spaces for 50 students, ICT facilities of minimum 50 computer terminals and extra units for the tutor and IT support staff with standard business office software, a library and e library give access, books, periodicals and journals and learning space. </p></h4> 



<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>Library</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The library contains a full range of texts.  All core texts on the course will be available in the library, with one copy for every 20 students on the course and many from the Recommended Reading Lists in Unit Information Forms.  Online access via EMERALD thousands of electronic journals, to which STIMU has subscribed, and e-books are available.
STIMU is continually upgrading its library and providing updated books, reference materials and other supplemental study resources in various disciplines. STIMU continually add up to the number of each new books on the courses for architecture engineering, civil engineering, business management, ecommerce, logistics, entrepreneurship, financial services and management, accounting, human resource management, strategic management, Economics, Health and Science, English Language and Literature, Information Technology other disciplines as appropriate.
Other resource materials such as CDs and videos, news magazines, newspapers and journals are also provided in the library. Students may access the resources in the library or may take the books out after registration with the school librarian.   
The Library will be open from 9.00 am – 5.00 pm 5 days per week and additionally when required.   There is a standard lending operation of 2 weeks per book, students can borrow 4 books at any one time.   You may access books and materials by logging in on the Library Book Lending/Borrowing Registry through our Library on-duty staff. 
The Library Officer operates a reservation system which allows for extended borrowing.  For material not available due to licensing issues, reader’s will be made to cover the core material. </p></h4> 


<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1.5 Computing and Information Technology</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The University has a very strict policy on the appropriate use of its IT resources. Every student and member of staff is required to accept the Network Use Policy upon joining the University, and reminded of it on the front screen of every wifi login. Make sure you are familiar with, and abide by, the policy.  
Use of specific specialist software and hardware may be required within certain courses, and these specialist skills are taught within that subject area by tutors and demonstrators. 
The Computer laboratory is available for all students, staff and faculty and sometimes reserved for some classes.  The schedule for the use of the IT laboratory is posted on the main door of the computer room and on the school bulletin. Due to limited workstations and in some occasion during end of semesters when students are busy with semestral paper requirements you may need to reserve in advance for extra hours of use of computer workstations.  A reservation form is available at the Administration Office which you could show to the IT staff who will give you the priority slot on your reserved schedule. An IT staff is available round-the-clock during working hours to help you with any problem in the use of the computer software and hardware.   </p></h4> 



<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>1.6 Personal Academic Tutors</b></p></h3>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Every student has a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT), someone to help you achieve your goals. If you are not aware who your PAT is, you need to check with your Course Coordinator. Conversations with your PAT focus on unlocking potential, helping you to learn and become more self-aware, increase motivation, independence, and self-confidence.
Make sure you use the benefit of your PAT’s experience when you need help or advice, as well as for directed sessions. 
Your Personal Academic Tutor will make contact with you to arrange a meeting soon after you start your studies. 
PAT sessions are where you and some of your fellow students can get to know each other and the University. It’s important we get to know you as well, to find out your ambitions and plans and how we can help you make the very best of your time at University.  Your PAT can enable you to gain insight into what you have come to study at UoB. Your PAT will support your academic progress, helping you achieve your goals and guiding you through your studies. 
Tutoring is individual too. Your PAT will meet and advise you individually during the year. If you have personal worries or concerns that may affect your work, your PAT will be able to direct you to the right support. Do contact them as soon as a problem arises and don’t let it escalate. If you have anything confidential to discuss with your PAT tutor, drop them an email to ask for a one-to-one meeting.
Schedules with your PAT will be arranged at the beginning of the term to allow you to choose a flexible schedule with your PAT. </p></h4> 




<h3><p style="color:#050930;"><b>2. Study Skills and Related Issues</b></p></h3>
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.1 Time Management</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">During your time at University you are likely to be juggling academic work with other demands such as paid employment and family commitments. In order to achieve a successful balance it is important to plan. One way of managing these demands that works effectively for many students, whatever their level of study, is to draw up a list of tasks you need to carry out in order to complete your academic work successfully (attending classes, collecting information, reading, note taking, writing and so on) then plot these on a weekly timetable working backwards from assignment deadlines (these can be found in the unit sites).
You will obviously need to construct this timetable in such a way as to accommodate the other demands on your time, always allowing some extra time to cope with unexpected matters, such not being able to find the right book or journal when you want it, computer malfunctions, extra shifts at work or family illness.
Professional and Academic Development run valuable academic skills workshops which are free to all students. One of these tackles organisation and time management. 
The University ferry is available 6 days a week from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to help you beat the hassles of the heavy traffic or the rainy season and ensure you get on time for your lectures, library schedules or school events.  To qualify for the ferry you have to arrange early with the Admin support office for your chosen time slot.  Allow for an early reservation as the ferry is open on a first–come first-serve basis and priorities are given to students who may have some physical disability considerations.</p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.2 Note-taking in Class</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">In lectures and seminars, it is good practice to take notes even if hand-outs are provided. You might, for example, jot down your understanding of what is being said in your own words or repeat some of the examples given to illustrate key points. The very act of writing will help you to concentrate as well as to fix the ideas and issues in your memory and assist understanding.
Where handouts are not provided, don’t try to take down everything the lecturer says but concentrate on key issues. The lecturer will often assist in this process by putting the main points on LMS. Don’t limit your notes to the points on the slides though. What you want to concentrate on is what else the lecturer is saying. Note the examples or words and phrases that particularly convey the meaning for you. As your knowledge and understanding of our subject grows, and you are practised at note taking, you will probably take fewer, more focused notes.
Build the task of writing up or word processing your notes as soon after the lecture or seminar as possible into your timetable. This will assist understanding by further fixing the ideas and issues in your mind and highlighting any areas of confusion to clear up through further reading or directly with the lecturer concerned.</p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.3 Note-taking for Assignments</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">You will also need to make notes of the reading you do when preparing for assignments. When writing an essay, report, or seminar paper, for example, you might undertake some initial general reading to work out your overall approach to tackling the issues involved.
Use the reading suggested in the unit reading list or flagged up by teaching team. At this point, you might need to take only brief notes to record the sources you have drawn on and the key points addressed. Once you have drawn up an assignment plan (see next section) then you will need to take further notes of your reading under the different headings outlined in your plan. Don’t be tempted to simply copy from the book, journal or Internet site unless you intend to quote directly from that source. Rather focus only on the essential points you want to convey, and try to express in your own words the essence of ideas and issues expressed and their relationship to the assignment topic you are addressing.
Above all, write down or log the source of your notes where they are drawn from another author. The easiest way is to construct an overall list of full references, then in your own notes you need only record the last name of the author, publication date and page number. It is essential that you do this so that you can identify the source if you want to return to it and critically so that you reference correctly in your completed assignment.</p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.4 Writing up Assignments</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The key to effective assignment writing is preparation, which in turn involves planning and time management. Having a plan is essential. Study the assignment guidelines, work out what is required and do some initial reading and planning. Ensure plenty of time to check your approach with the lecturer concerned during an office hour or pre-arranged time well before the assignment is due in and refine your plan as necessary. An effective plan outlines the structure of your assignment, which should include an introduction, a middle section (main body) and conclusion. For the middle, it is useful in a plan to list the different sections of your assignment under headings underneath which you can make a brief note of the issues you intend to discuss in that section. At the beginning of each section in your plan you should also make a note of its relevance to the assignment title and to the preceding discussion. This will help you to construct a discussion that flows according to an explicit logic. In the case of an essay, for example, this will often consist in presenting first the pros then the cons of an argument. Whilst it is not usual to use sub headings in an essay (although you would use them in say a report or seminar paper), you need to be clear in your plan about the ordering of your discussion and the way that the points you are making connect. Without a plan, your discussion is likely to lack focus and to be driven by your reading rather than by the question and your own informed thinking.
Once you have developed a plan, you can undertake more detailed reading and note taking as outlined below. Adapt your plan if necessary to take in important new points or shift the emphasis, but don’t be tempted off at a tangent by something you have read which may seem interesting but which is not strictly relevant to the question. When adapting your plan, go through the same procedure of noting the relevance of each point to that section and to the discussion as a whole.</p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.5 Guidance on Proof reading</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Proof reading is the process whereby the final draft of a piece of academic work is checked for errors in grammar, style, formatting and spelling for amendment before submission.  The University of Bedfordshire recommends that students proof read their own work as a matter of good practice.  The University does not provide a proof reading service and it is not appropriate to ask your tutors to proof read your work.  
If you ask a fellow student or other individual to proof read your work you must ensure that this does not involve editing the text to make significant changes to terminology or the ideas presented.  There is an important difference between grammar and spelling, which it is acceptable to amend, and knowledge and understanding which must be your own.  This guidance is designed to illustrate what is acceptable.
Your work must show your own ideas on the topic supported by evidence and information from sources which are correctly referenced.  Thus, it is not acceptable for someone else to change the vocabulary, terms and phrases within an assignment as this would then mean that the work submitted is no longer your work.  You are responsible for the academic work which you submit. Any errors or academic offences within a piece of work submitted for marking will be considered your responsibility and not that of the proof reader. If work which is proof read is returned with changes already made, you cannot be certain that these changes are not plagiarised. If substantial amounts of text have been changed, then it may be considered that the work is not completely your own work which is considered a serious academic offence. </p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What is acceptable?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">If someone else proof reads an assessment they should do so well in advance and only be checking for the following:</p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Typing errors </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Spelling </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Punctuation </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> .Formatting </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Inconsistencies in presentation </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Clarity of argument </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> .Referencing errors (such as missing quotation marks or citations, and missing sources in the reference list where a citation has been used in the text)
A proof reader should identify any of the above errors on the draft so that you can then check and make corrections should you wish to do so. The proof reader should not make the changes for you or suggest alternatives.  Thus the following are not acceptable and may lead to an academic offence. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What is not acceptable?</b> </p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Rewriting text to change the meaning </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Rewriting text to change an argument </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Rearranging the structure of the assignment </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> .Suggesting alternatives </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Correcting errors that are factual or calculated from data (although the errors may be pointed out) </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Correcting plagiarism </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Changing the vocabulary  </p></h4>



<h3><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>2.6 Referencing</b> </p></h3>
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Referencing - an essential skill</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">In your assignments you are expected to reference everything you have read and used, whether this is a direct quote or a paraphrase (using your words to describe what others have written or said). This could include a whole range of resources such as books, articles, web pages, pictures, film, performances, blogs, sound recordings. </p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Why do you have to reference?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">At university level you need to read widely and understand the ideas of other people. You also need to be able to interpret, discuss and incorporate this into your academic work because you will be assessed on your understanding and your use of these resources. Referencing is a way of proving you have done this and of indicating the ideas that are yours and those that belong to other authors.  Not referencing correctly is effectively misappropriating the ideas of others. Referencing enables you and your readers to trace useful material again and will make your work look scholarly.  </p></h4> 



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Which style should you use?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">You must use the Harvard style of referencing. You can also find advice and guidance in the Learning Resources referencing web pages. </p></h4> 



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Where to go for help?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">As part of your course, you will have the opportunity to learn how to reference, this might be done by your Unit Leaders or your Librarians.   </p></h4> 



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Where to go for help?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">As part of your course, you will have the opportunity to learn how to reference, this might be done by your Unit Leaders or your Librarians.   </p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Language skills</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Your personal academic tutor will give you advice on how to improve your academic and social English such as in interpreting data and understanding a huge volume of essay reports and cases, and academic writing.  The Faculty Library also contains various English study resources (written materials, video and audio CDs) that include topics in academic writing, reading, speaking and listening skills, thesis writing which you can use inside the library or borrow on specified time convenient to you.  IT services at the Computer Laboratory room is also available to help you log in to online English language tutorials. </p></h4> 



<h3><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3. Assessment</b> </p></h3>
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.1 Assessment Tasks</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Assessment is not just about ‘grading’ your performance but is an integral and important developmental part of your learning. Preparation for assessment, undertaking the set tasks and using the feedback provided helps you to develop and demonstrate skills as well as evidencing your knowledge and understanding.
Your tutors will provide details of the specific tasks for each unit. You may also be provided with additional assessment briefings, and staff will use the teaching time with you to explore what is expected within each assignment and how it links to the course and unit learning outcomes. 
For every assessment you do, staff will indicate what is required of you, how you will be marked and details of when the assessment is due to be submitted.
Your Unit Leader will provide you with specific guidance on completing all tasks, including written, oral and practical tasks.  </p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>For written tasks</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Make an outline plan and stick to it when writing up your first draft. In your introduction – which may be the last section you write – outline the key themes pursued in the assignment and the order in which you are tackling them. In the main body of the assignment, write a linking sentence or phrase at the beginning of each new section to show where the discussion is going and how it relates to the last section and to the task as a whole.
Until you are fluent in subject specific terminology, it is better to use your own words when writing up your notes. This will assist your understanding and better communicate the level of your comprehension to the marker. In your conclusion, draw the threads of recommendations as required by the assignment task.
Ideally you will have allowed sufficient time in your action plan (see time management) to put this draft aside for a short period. Then you will come back to it with a fresh mind and will be better equipped to spot errors, lack of clarity in the discussion or missing elements.
Be prepared that you will draft, redraft and continue redrafting, usually until you run out of time. Remember to check for spelling, grammatical, factual and referencing errors before you submit anything at whatever level you are studying. Don't lose marks unnecessarily. </p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Writing in Academic English</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Academic English:</p></h4> 

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . is usually formal in tone and impersonal in style </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . avoids contractions or shortened forms of verbs, such as won’t, doesn’t or it’s</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . avoids using a linking word such as ‘and’ or ‘but’ at the beginning of a sentence </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . avoids personal pronouns such as I, me, you, your </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> .may use the passive form of verbs </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . avoids verbs that are composed of multiple words, such as ‘give up’, ‘put up with’</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . tends to employ a cautious way of explaining findings, using expressions such as ‘may’, ‘it is possible that…’, ‘could’  </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . may use specialised vocabulary. </p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.2 Coursework Submission</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">You may also submit your coursework online (assignments, projects) through the STIMU Learning Management System (LMS) for fast and easy communication. 
Each assessment brief will also carry details of the learning outcomes your work will be expected to meet, how you will be expected to deliver your work, the format, the presentation, the deadline date and information about how to receive the essential feedback on your work. These are all provided to support you to succeed - but if you are unclear about assessment requirements or submission procedures, ask your tutor either in the taught sessions or in their office hours. See the Mitigating Circumstances section below for advice about what to do if you think you won't be able to meet a deadline. Do note that lecturers are not able to extend deadlines.</p></h4> 


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.3 Exams</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">To request an extension or reassessment you must submit a completed Mitigating Circumstances Application Form and provide appropriate independent evidence.
Mitigating CThe really useful Exam Information site from the LMS contains essential information about exams and the exam timetable when it is available. 
The University recognises that during your time at University you may experience serious and exceptional circumstances that are unavoidable and affect your ability to complete an assessment or sit an exam.
Lecturers cannot grant you an extension on an assignment or a re-assessment opportunity for an exam. The only team who can award extra time for your work or another attempt at an exam is the Student Engagement and Mitigation (SEAM) Team within Student Support.ircumstances Application Forms accompanied by appropriate evidence must be submitted to SEAM before or on the submission date for the assessment.  If your application is not submitted to SEAM on or before the assessment submission date, your application will normally be refused.
Late applications will only be considered in exceptional circumstances and will be decided upon by the Student Engagement and Mitigation Team. Details on the procedure will be explained by the Student Advisory and Mitigation Team and your Faculty advisors.

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Coursework must be handed in by the date and time specified. This will be given to you in due course during program orientation as well as at the bulletin boards.
 Late work without formal agreement is not accepted, and will be deemed a fail and marked at 0 (no work submitted). We are very firm about this because working to deadlines is an important life skill which we encourage you to develop during your studies. Sometimes things outside your control can affect your ability meet a deadline. If you believe that you are likely to miss a deadline for a valid reason (see below for reasons considered valid under mitigating circumstances) then you should apply to the Student Support Team (through your course coordinator) for an extension. Only they can make the decision. It is important to realise that your lecturers are not able to extend published deadlines.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What are mitigating circumstances?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Examples of circumstances that would justify special consideration include:</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Serious personal injury, broken limbs, or a medical condition requiring hospital attention or with an incapacitating effect. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . An acute illness that makes it impossible to complete the required task.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Being a victim of a serious crime during the period immediately preceding assessment. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . The serious illness or death of a close relative: normally a partner, parent, child or sibling. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Birth of a baby and/or unforeseen pregnancy complication.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Normally not acceptable are:</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . The death or illness of a distant relative. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Financial problems, including payment of fees to the University.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Difficulties with housing. </p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Difficulties with baby-sitters, child-minders. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Transport difficulties such as public transport strikes, road works or private transport breakdowns.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Confusion over time, date location of the examination, or assignment hand-in date on the part of the candidate when this has been clearly notified, and has not posed any problem to other students in the group.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Work pressure if you are enrolled as a full-time student.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Cases where medical certificates are retrospective, i.e. dated/issued after you have recovered from the illness claimed. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Any claim not supported by independent and reliable evidence.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Computer problems such as viruses, memory stick failure/loss, printer problems, network problems.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Problems with receiving/submitting referral work and results. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Problems handing in an assignment to the designated place by the deadline.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Cent.ollecting data/more data for an assignm</p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Essential Advice:</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">If you submit a claim for mitigating circumstances, don't assume it will be accepted. You need to do your best to get work prepared because it is your responsibility to complete your assignments/sit exams in order to progress on your course.</p></h4>




<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.5 Results and Using Feedback</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The University uses a percentage marking system to grade your performance.</p></h4>
<div class="row">
               <div class="col-sm-10" style="background-color:lightcyan;">
                <img height="768" width="521" src="<?php echo url(); ?>/images/exam.png" alt="" />
               </div>

             
        </div>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The weightings for each assignment will be given in the relevant assessment information.
We feel it important that you receive focused, meaningful and timely feedback to support your learning. It is also important that you reflect upon and use any feedback to develop your skills and improve performance. In line with other institutions, the University utilises a series of marking strategies to ensure that your work gets the mark that it deserves. Your work will be graded by your tutor and will also be second marked independently to ensure that the grade is appropriate.  In addition, an independent external examiner from outside the University samples student’s work to ensure that our standards are consistent with those at other universities.  As a result, the initial marks that you receive on your work are provisional and may vary slightly from the final mark which is confirmed at exams boards at the end of the year.
External Examiners write annual reports on your course. You can access those for your course by contacting your tutor and they will be shared with your representatives at Course team meetings and Portfolio Committees (we are currently exploring how to make these more readily available to you).</p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.6 Appeals</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Because of the steps we take to ensure that your marks are correct you can only appeal against the mark given in certain circumstances and only after an examination board has confirmed the mark.  Appeal forms are available at the Administrative Office.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.7 Academic Offences</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Academic offences include a range of actions designed to deceive and gain an unfair advantage over other students. This is unethical and threatens the integrity of our assessment procedures and the value of the University’s academic awards. 
Your academic performance will be assessed on the basis that anything you submit for assessment is your own work. Anyone thought to be gaining an unfair advantage in any form of assessment is subject to formal investigation in accordance with University Regulations.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are not vulnerable to any allegation that you have breached these regulations (for example by sharing your assignments with friends in such a way that they can copy your work and claim it as their own).
Penalties for students found to have committed an academic offence may include failure in a unit or an element of a unit which may mean that you have to repeat the year as a part-time student and bear the associated financial cost. In extreme cases you may be required to leave the University.
During the course we will introduce you to correct academic practice to help ensure that you know what we are looking for in your assessments.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Plagiarism</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Plagiarism is the most common mistake.  This is presenting the work or ideas of someone else as your own. If you repeat someone else's words or images and claim them as your own, or present someone’s line of thinking as if it was your own, you will have plagiarised. You can use other people’s ideas, words and images, but it’s important that you acknowledge them through appropriate referencing. Plagiarism may be deliberate or accidental, but if it occurs within your work it will be considered an academic offence by your tutor.
Remember that your examiners want to assess your ability, not those of others, so it’s important that you interpret others’ work and that there is sufficient of your own work in your assignments for your ability to be assessed.
You should keep a careful record of all the sources you use, including all internet material, and ensure that you understand correct referencing practices. Following 'referencing conventions' will protect you against plagiarism (see the earlier section on referencing).  </p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Collaboration or collusion?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Collaboration 	working with others is often essential. Collusion working with others to deceive is cheating and not allowed.
Discussing ideas with your fellow students is part of learning, and we encourage you to do this, to exchange interesting and relevant sources and references. There is a distinction between sharing ideas and collusion, which is an academic offence.
When completing an individual assignment you must not work with others to the extent of exchanging written materials that you have prepared, such as notes or assignments or drafts, unless you have been expressly told that this is permissible. If these types of materials are shared and submitted it will be regarded as an offence for the person who lends the material as well as the person who uses it.  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Protecting your work</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Your own work should be regarded as your own property and you should protect it. </p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Always submit your own work rather than asking a fellow student to submit work for you.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . If you are working in a shared space, log off from the computer you are using whenever you take a break so others cannot access or copy your work. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Any claim not supported by independent and reliable evidence.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Take care to destroy printed drafts or copies of work, rather than merely discarding them.</p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> .Don't give your work to others in any format unless this is part of a set task. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . If you are working on a group or team assignment, make sure you understand the allocation of responsibilities between yourself and the other members of the team.</p></h4>

<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"> . Make sure that you correctly label your work files so that the version you submit is the correct and final version.</p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What is counted as cheating in exams?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">To avoid cheating, you must not communicate with other students during an exam or test, and you must not take into the exam or test room any materials, notes or aids, other than those which have been officially authorised in the examination paper. If an invigilator observes you with any prohibited material, notes or equipment or observes you communicating with another student, your actions will be investigated and you may be subject to a penalty. The rules and details are also explained during the induction and at the start of every examination. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>3.8 Course Regulations</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">This section summarises what you need to do to pass and progress through your studies. The full and definitive version is provided in the University's Regulations.  </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Passing units and Progressing</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">To pass a unit you must attempt all the assessments and submit them by the deadline. Failure to meet the deadline is classed as a non-submission. You will be permitted a referral or resit attempt for a non-submission only if you have engaged with the unit. 
Each assessment you undertake will have a weighting towards the overall grade for the unit.  This will be given in the assignment brief.  To pass a unit you must gain an aggregate grade of 40%. The aggregate may include an individual assessment mark at 35 - 39% but it should not normally include an individual assessment grade of less than 35%. 
To progress between stages 1 and 2, you must have attempted all 120 credits and passed at least 90 academic credits with a grade of 40%. You cannot start the research project if you have failed the research methods unit.
In the final stage of your course, you must pass your research project with a grade of at least 40%.  </p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What if I fail an assessment?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">If you fail one point of assessment in a multi-assessment unit with a mark between 35 – 39% you will pass the unit if your overall aggregate grade is greater than 40%. 
If you fail one point of assessment in a multi-assessment unit with a grade of less than 35% then you will normally be given a referral (depending on the nature of the assessment) which must be completed to progress even if the aggregate grade is above 40%.  </p></h4>



<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>What if I fail a unit?</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">If you fail a unit you will be required to retake that unit at the next scheduled opportunity. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Classification</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">A Bachelor’s degree may be awarded to a student who has attained a grade of 40% or above overall and in the dissertation (research project) stage.
The Bachelor’s degree with Honours is awarded in classes of First (1); Upper Second (2i); Lower Second (2ii) and Third (3). The Bachelor’s degree (without Honours) is awarded without any classes or divisions. </p></h4>


<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>Examination Boards</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">Courses have two levels of formal decision-making on your progression and awards: Portfolio Boards and the Scheme Boards. Portfolio Boards involve internal and external examiners (experienced academics from other universities who ensure that our standards are correct).  The Board helps ensure that the marks you have been given are accurate and appropriate to the standard of work you submitted.  Scheme Boards ensure consistency across the university and confirm final awards. </p></h4>



<h3><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>4. Having Your Say</b> </p></h3> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;"><b>4.1 University Student Council</b> </p></h4> 
<h4><p class="opacity" style="color:#050930;">The STIMU Student Council is a union of students from every year level of STIMU and work hand in hand to make their university experience fruitful and dynamic and the university campus a better place. USC Officers together with the USC Committee Chair and members organize events and implement activities during the school year such as seminars, fund raising, study tours, school celebrations and competitions. Membership in the Committees is open to all students. Students who want to join the Committees are welcome to choose their own committee and sign up. 
The Student Council was initially intended to provide a representative structure through which the students can voice their concerns, debate on issues, undertake initiatives to benefit the school and the wider community and leave a lasting legacy of academic and community contributions. Specifically, it is aimed to allow the students the experience of creating their own projects and developing their own creativity, give them the opportunity to link with other schools and institutions thereby expanding their opportunities, involved in school and outside events such as sports, research projects, seminars and academic competitions. It also serves as a source of peer support for each student or groups of students from every faculty as academic network among students and teachers is enhanced. To top it all, the Council creates an enormous positive impact on the confidence and leadership skills of all the students. However, as it is a new concept in Myanmar schools, the establishment of the first STIMU University Student Council (USC) followed a rigorous process which included a learning process, thorough consultation and dialogue on the conduct of campaign and election, process of selection and voting, identification of committees, development of the student body by-laws, development of the duties and responsibilities of officers and committees and the corresponding vision, plans, duties and responsibilities of candidates and committees, as well as the determination of the necessary short term and medium support from the management. It also included a well-coordinated university-wide orientation among faculties and students of the whole concept, process, and role of each of the students. To date the council has witnessed three yearly campaigns and elections since its inception in 2014. New officers and members continually work actively in the campus activities and foster university community spirit among students from all year levels in the three campuses. </p></h4>
